# RoShanBot

## What is RoShanBot?
RoShanBot is a machine learning program written in Python and using the [Tensorflow library][tf].
It uses a camera to recognize hand positions and will essentially play a simple game of rock-paper-scissors.
This was a school project originally, but I eventually plan on further development.
